# Mission To Mars

The purpose of this repository was to illustrate what Iâ€™ve learned about HTML and web scraping.  We used chromedriver, Splinter, and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the web and used flask to create a web application to display the results.  We also learned basic HTML and used Bootstrap elements to customize the website.
